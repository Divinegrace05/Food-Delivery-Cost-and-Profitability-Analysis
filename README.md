# **Food Delivery Cost and Profitability Analysis**  

## **Project Overview**  
This project aims to analyze the **costs, revenues, and profitability** of a food delivery service. By examining **order values, commission fees, delivery times, and refund trends**, we derive key insights to optimize operations and enhance profitability.  

The analysis covers aspects such as:  
✅ Identifying the **most common payment method and its proportion**  
✅ Calculating the **average order value and commission fees**  
✅ Analyzing **delivery times and customer payment behavior**  
✅ Evaluating **refund trends and chargebacks**  
✅ Conducting **statistical hypothesis testing** on delivery efficiency

## **Key Findings**  

### 🔹 **1. Payment Method Trends**  
✅ The **most common payment method** accounts for **32.73% to 38.67%** of transactions.  
✅ Cash on Delivery orders **tend to have higher order values** than Digital Wallet payments.  

### 🔹 **2. Revenue Insights**  
✅ The **average commission fee per order** is **₹126.99**, with a **median of ₹127.00**.  
✅ Customers spend **₹1053.97 per order on average**.  
✅ **55% of orders contribute a commission fee greater than ₹120**, impacting revenue positively.  

### 🔹 **3. Delivery Time Analysis**  
✅ The **average delivery time** for **Credit Card orders is 74.01 minutes**, which is relatively high.  
✅ **50% of deliveries take between 50 to 96 minutes**.  
✅ **Hypothesis testing** confirmed that **delivery time is significantly greater than 53 minutes**, indicating potential inefficiencies.  

### 🔹 **4. Refund and Chargeback Trends**  
✅ **Credit Card transactions** have the highest refund cases (**102 cases**), followed by **Cash on Delivery (101 cases)** and **Digital Wallet (82 cases)**.  
✅ This suggests a need for **better payment dispute resolution strategies**.
